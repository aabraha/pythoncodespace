# Dictionary: a key-value data structure
myDict = {
  "one":1,
  "two": 2,
  3: "three",
  4.5: ["four","point","five"]
}

# print(myDict)

# dictionaries are accessed via keys
# print(myDict["one"])
# print(myDict[3])

# you can also set dictionary data by creating a new key

myDict["seven"] = 7
# print(myDict)
# Trying to access a nonexistent key will produce an error
# print(myDict["blabla"])

# To avoid this, you can use the "in" operator to see if a key exists
# print("two" in myDict)
# print("blabla" in myDict)

# You can retrieve all of the keys and values from a dictionary
# print(myDict)
# print(myDict.keys())
# print(myDict.values())

# You can also iterate over all the items in a dictionary
for key, val in myDict.items():
